## Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website built using Next.js and React. It highlights my expertise, projects, and achievements as a Full Stack Engineer. The website is designed with a clean and modern UI using Tailwind CSS for styling, TypeScript for type safety, email integration for contact, and Framer Motion for smooth animations.

## Deployments & Branches

| Branch    | Description           | Deployment URL                                                              |
|-----------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main`    | Production (stable)   | [nazrulislam.in](https://nazrulislam.in/), [nazrulislam.dev](https://nazrulislam.dev/) |
| `release` | Pre-release/Staging   | [nazrulislam.vercel.app](https://nazrulislam.vercel.app/)                                   |
| `develop` | Active development    | N/A â€“ used for testing before production      |

## Branching Strategy

We follow a structured Git branching model for clean, predictable releases and smooth feature development.

main â†’ Production (live on nazrulislam.in and nazrulislam.dev)
â””â”€â”€ release â†’ Staging/Pre-release testing
â””â”€â”€ develop â†’ Active development

### PR Flow

1. All new features and bugfixes are created from and merged into `develop`.
2. Once `develop` is stable and ready for release, a PR is made into `release`.
   - The `release` branch is deployed to the **develop domain** for pre-release testing.
3. If everything works as expected on `release`, a final PR is created from `release` into `main` to go live.

### Summary

- âœ… **`main`**: Stable production-ready code.
- ðŸ§ª **`release`**: Tested staging builds, awaiting promotion to production.
- ðŸ§ª **`develop`**: Active development branch.
