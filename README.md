## 🌳 Branching Strategy

A streamlined Git workflow ensures smooth sailing from idea to production:

```
main (production/live)
│
├── release (staging/pre-release)
│
└── develop (active development)
```

### 🔄 PR Flow

1. **Feature & Bugfix:** Branch off and merge into `develop`.
2. **Ready for Release:** Merge `develop` into `release` for staging and QA.
3. **Go Live:** Once tested, merge `release` into `main` for production.

**Branches at a glance:**
- **`main`**: 🚀 Stable, production-ready.
