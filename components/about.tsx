        Hi, I’m a passionate Software Engineer with over 4+ years of experience
        specializing in front-end technologies. My primary expertise lies in the
        JavaScript (ES6+) ecosystem, particularly with React JS and Next JS. I'm
        dedicated to leveraging technology to solve complex problems and
        continuously learning to keep up with the latest industry trends. I
        thrive in environments where I can explore new tools, frameworks, and
        best practices to build scalable and efficient solutions. My journey as
        a developer has been all about rapid adaptation and growth. I enjoy
        transforming ideas into functional, user-friendly digital experiences.
        Beyond coding, I’m someone who values collaboration, creativity, and
        continuous improvement.
